## Background
West Nile Virus is most commonly spread to humans through infected mosquitos. Due to the recent epidemic in City of Chicago, Chicago Department of Publich Health (CDPH) had established a surveillance and control program. The program entails setting mosquito traps, testing for WNV and spraying of airborne pesticides in the city.

Every year from late-May to early-October, CDPH setup mosquito traps scattered across the city. Every week from Monday through Wednesday, these traps collect mosquitos, and the mosquitos are tested for the presence of West Nile virus before the end of the week. The test results include the number of mosquitos, the mosquitos species, and whether or not West Nile virus is present in the cohort.

Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has engaged Disease and Treatment Agency (DATA) for the following services:
- To conduct a review on the surveillance and control program through data analytics
- To conduct a cost-benefit analysis on the annual cost projections for various levels of pesticide coverage and  the effect of of these various levels of pesticide coverage

DATA is responsible to analyze the mosquito trap location, testing and spraying datasets given by CDPH, and weather datasets given by National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) to predict whether or not West Nile virus is present, for a given time, location, and species.

## Problem Statement

- To build a classification model with high specificity & sensitivity (ROC-AUC) on the probability of presence of WNV so as to aid CDC in deriving an effective pesticide deployment plan
- To conduct a cost-benefit analysis on the annual cost projections for various level of pesticide coverage and the effects of these various levels of pesticide coverage

## EDA
1. 
  
## Feature Engineering
The following shows the feature engineering process:
1. Feature Elimination
2. Encoding of Categorical Features
3. Data Scaling
4. Handling of imbalance WNV present data


## Modeling
The following shows the modeling process:
1. Train-Test Split
2. Hyperparameter Tuning
3. Cross Validation
4. Test Prediction
5. Evaluation

The following shows the models built and the ROC AUC score used for evaluation:
1. Logistic Regression
- CV: 0.893 
- Test: 0.737
2. Random Forest
- CV: 0.972
- Test: 0.714 
3. XGBoost
- Train: 0.984 
- Test: 0.635

The Random Forest model was selected for Kaggle submission, yielded a ROC AUC score of approximately 0.75.
